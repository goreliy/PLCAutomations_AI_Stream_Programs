# PLCAI-Stream-Programs Repository

Welcome to the PLCAI-Stream-Programs repository! This repository houses programs written during the live streams on the YouTube channel PLCAutomations. These programs are developed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and cover a variety of topics.

## Topics Covered

1. PID Control
2. Modbus Device Discovery
3. Simple OPC UA Server

## PID Control

In this section, you will find programs related to PID control. These programs demonstrate the application of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithms for various systems.

## Modbus Device Discovery

The Modbus Device Discovery section contains programs that focus on the discovery and communication with Modbus devices. You will find examples of how to search for Modbus devices and establish connections for data exchange.

## Simple OPC UA Server

Explore programs related to creating a simple OPC UA server. This section includes code examples that demonstrate the creation of an OPC UA server for data exchange and communication with other devices.
